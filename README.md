# Minesweeper clone

Written in a week or so using C++ and SDL2.

## Build

You can build on linux assuming you have sdl2 and sdl2_image installed with:
```
make
```

You can run by executing `build/minesweeper` or running:
```
make run
```

You can probably compile on windows under wsl or msys in the same way (again assuming you have sdl2 and sdl2_image)
